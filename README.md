# wind-rust-api
Made for the high speed operations required in Wind.

## How to set up
Setting up this project requires a few things:
* install rust and rustup
* install cargo watch, "cargo install cargo-watch"

After installing, we can start the server by running "cargo watch -x run". This will begin the start of the unoptimized build and runs on port 8080.
If using the wind-js-server, we can concurrently run both backend services by running "yarn dev" on the wind-js-server repo.
